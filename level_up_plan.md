BRAINSTORM

1. When we level up I would like for:
    a. You get to upgrade a skill tree. each upgrade unlocks a couple of potential random options. So one upgrade could unlock 3 - 5 options.
    b. You choose a skill from a list of possiblities based on how you have upgraded the skill tree. 

    OR 
    a.  We establish a few luck based skills componenets. These would be more powerful and unique with abilities.
    b.  We still have a skill tree but this will just upgrade basic things such as hp, ap, maybe some basic skills and luck etc...

    OR
    a. skills and attributes and perks system just like fallout
    
    OR 
    a.


2. Each ability needs an ap_cost but effects vary greatly between what kind of ability it is. Ie. dash vs damaging ability.

3. The more I think about it I think I need to develop out the abilities and the skill tree and what each perk, ability, and base attribute modification we can incorporate into the game.

    I. Abilities:
        A. movement
            a.  dash:
                This ability will dash X distance in the direction the player is moving.
                It can upgrade via ability point cost, distance, and at higher levels avoid damage and deal damage.

            b. Movement speed:
                Just a base speed boost. 
                At higher levels activate an ability to slow all enemies
            c. Blink
                first level is a lot like dash only if near a thin wall can go through it.
                Leveling can lower ap cost.
                Higher level player can select anywhere on screen and blink where mouse cursor is(ap drain dependent on distance)
            d. Phase-Out
                first level allows you to walk through walls.
                second level allows you to walk through creature(and be undamaged).
                third level damages creatures as you walk through them(should make creatures run from player).
            
        B. Crowd control:
            a. Wall
                spawn wall with time limit
                increased wall time limit
                Wall has damaging UV aura
            b. Gravity Well
                Spawn AOE slow area(No extra large creatures effected)
                Slow area does damage
                slow area instead pulls all enemies into the middle of AOE effect(No extra large creatures effected)
            c. repulse
                Pushes all enemies away in a cone and deals a small amount of damage
                Increased damage
                Pushes enemies away all around the player
                Increased push distance
            d. Taze-stun:
                Fires like a bullet. Hit enemy is stunned.
                Increased duration
                When collision occurs it stuns other creatures around that creature for a shorter duration
            e. Bear trap 
                roots the first enemy that steps on it. small
